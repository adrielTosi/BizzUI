# 🐝 BizzUI

BizzUI is a quizz for answering some questions about UI design. It was created for helping developers and designer to better understand how the community feels about UI pieces.

### 👊 Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

The project is shipped with my portfolio, so the interesting folder for your contributions is:  
```
.
├── src  
   └── components  
     └── BizzUI
```
Although, as stated, any contribution is welcome.
